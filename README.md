## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm learning Python and Al to create solutions that can benefit a great number of people, regarding their mental health. As a former psychologist, I aim to mix my human-centered knowledge with technical skills to achieve that goal. I'm looking for mentors that can guide me in this journey, any type of feedback is welcome.

I hope you enjoy my progress as much as I do!
